## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/DSST.git
   cd DSST/frontend-new
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

### Build for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized files ready for deployment.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

After pushing your repository to GitHub, to deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings > Pages
3. In the "Source" section, select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose the "main" branch and "/docs" folder
5. Click "Save"

GitHub will generate a URL where your application is hosted (typically `https://[YOUR-USERNAME].github.io/DSST`).

### Alternative Deployment Method

You can also deploy directly using the gh-pages npm package:

```bash
cd frontend-new
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy the application from the build folder to the gh-pages branch, which GitHub can then serve.
